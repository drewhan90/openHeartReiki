				"Reiki is unfathomable, immeasurable, and being an universal life force, it is incomprehensible to man. 
				<br>
				Yet, every single living being is receiving its blessings daily, awake and asleep.” 
				<br> - <a href="http://www.reiki.org/faq/historyofreiki.html">Hawayo Takata, Reiki Grand Master</a>
				<br><br>
				Reiki (ray-key) means universal life energy, the energy found in all things.
				<br><br>
				When connected with <a href="#benefit">Reiki</a> in a conscious way, an individual has the possibility of healing, awakening, and enlivening through this practice.

					<b><a href="http://www.usuishikiryohoreiki.com/">Usui Shiki Ryoho</a></b> (the Usui System of Natural Healing or Reiki Healing) is named after its founder, Dr. Mikao Usui. Relying on an oral history, the story of Dr. Usui's journey is one filled with the desire to seek the answer to a burning question of <em>"How did Jesus heal?"</em>
					<br>
					His dedication to his search and his individual gifts allowed him to receive the gift of Reiki. After receiving the gift of connection with Reiki energy, he spent the rest of his life developing the system of practice allowing this gift of connection to be passed on to others. The immense gift of this method of passing on the connection has survived many generations and has remained viable throughout the cultures of the world.

					<b>Chujiro Hayashi</b> continued his studentship of Usui Shiki Ryoho by opening a clinic. His clinic allowed him to observe the effects of the treatment on many people with many different ailments. 
					<br>
					<b>Mrs. Hawayo Takata</b> of Hawaii recovered from her serious ailments at Hayashi’s Reiki clinic and became his first student who did not live in Japan. She practiced and taught throughout the US and Canada from 1937 to her death in 1980. Her legacy of treatment throughout these years and her dedicated living within the Reiki practice gave all of her students the benefit of Mikao Usui's gift. Her granddaughter, Phyllis Lei Furumoto, now carries on her work.

						I lived an ordinary life in Russia as an office clerk. Although, my life was very stable, I felt empty, useless and unhappy. Still, I found happiness from traveling and having new experiences. This curiosity brought me to Vancouver and opened a new chapter in my life. I had yet to know that I would soon open my heart to <b>reiki</b>. 
						<br>
						In 2011, I was lucky to meet my Reiki Master, now dear friend, on the second day of my arrival. I had been  introduced to Reiki's profound healing powers first hand. Reiki helped me to manage my chronic illness, lightened my mood and opened my heart and eyes. I learned to enjoy every moment adn take in the world's beauty.
						<br><br>
						I am blessed to have visited India to study with <b>Swami Samdarshi</b>, an enlightened master and disciple of Osho. For several years, I have practiced Osho meditations. Osho mediation allowed me to look into suppressed emotions, fears, angers, traumas and issues lingering in my daily life. 
						<br><br>
						When my body was healthy enough for another physical transformation, I received the gift of <b>yoga</b>.
						I've taken a teacher's training program at <b>Karma Teachers</b>. I learned the importance of exploring the connection between the physical and spiritual self.
						<br><br>
						My longing to understand myself led me to dive into woman studies and the connection to Goddess Mother – divine power of <b><a href="http://www.shaktima.org/">Shakti Ma</a></b> and source of creation all around us. For us women is very important to understand the divine power of femininity, compassion and love, so we can be confident and compassionate in this fast paced world.
						I am grateful to God and the Universe for this wonderfully unpredictable journey called life, for being able to follow my true purpose in this life, to serve people and help them to transform theirself and become closer to the light, the divine source, and their true selves. 
						<br><br>
						I am looking forward to meeting you, hear your life journey, and work together to make your life journey happier, healthier and brighter.
						<br><br>
						Light and love from my open heart to yours,
						<br>
						Aneesha
