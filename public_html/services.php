          “Reiki” (ray - key) is a Japanese word meaning “universal life energy,” the energy found in all things. Usui Shiki Ryoho, applies this energy through touch for the purpose of creating the connection with Reiki.

          When connected with Reiki in a conscious way, an individual has the possibility of healing, awakening, and enlivening through this practice. “This power (Reiki) is unfathomable, immeasurable, and being a universal life force, it is incomprehensible to man. Yet, every single living being is receiving its blessings daily, awake and asleep.” - Hawayo Takata, Grand Master

          What is Reiki treatment? Are you tired, have sleeping problems, trying to manage the chronic pain or stressed at work? We all have different reason to look for a healing. I strongly believe that all healing comes from within. However, sometimes we need help to initiate this process of internal healing. Reiki is a very simple practice that can help to awake your body energies and balance them to help your body to heal and nourish itself. A Reiki treatment supports the whole person on all levels of your being: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. Reiki treatment can be performed by Reiki practitioners for themselves or for others. Self Reiki treatment can be done lying down and takes about 30-45 minutes. Reiki treatment for a patient is done on the Reiki table by applying hands on the fully clothed body. Most of my patience describe the sensation as worm waves of energy what bring relaxation for the body and mind. Ii is very common to fall asleep during the treatment. Reiki treatment for a patient usually takes about an hour; please allow more time if it is your first visit. Here are some benefits that people report having after the treatment: - Peace of mind - Promotes sleep - Relaxation of body and mind - Chronic pain and discomfort relieve - Balances energies in the body - Relaxes tight muscles - Easies tension and stress - Increases energy - Relieves fatigue - Clears toxins - Promotes feeling of calmness and well-being - Helps unlock suppressed feelings - Soothes emotional distress - Promotes a positive and peaceful outlook on life - Strengthens immune system - Slows down aging - Promotes stamina - Faster recovery from medical treatments and operations - Promotes positive changes in life Where Does the Usui System of Reiki Healing Come From? Usui Shiki Ryoho (the Usui System of Natural Healing or Reiki Healing) is named after its founder, Dr. Mikao Usui. Relying on an oral history, the story of Dr. Usui's journey is one filled with the desire to seek the answer to a burning question of "How did Jesus heal?" His dedication to his search and his individual gifts allowed him to receive the gift of Reiki. After receiving the gift of connection with Reiki energy, he spent the rest of his life developing the system of practice allowing this gift of connection to be passed on to others. The immense gift of this method of passing on the connection has survived many generations and has remained viable throughout the cultures of the world. Chujiro Hayashi continued his studentship of Usui Shiki Ryoho by opening a clinic. His clinic allowed him to observe the effects of the treatment on many people with many different ailments. Mrs. Hawayo Takata of Hawaii recovered from her serious ailments at Hayashi’s Reiki clinic and became his first student who did not live in Japan. She practiced and taught throughout the US and Canada from 1937 to her death in 1980. Her legacy of treatment throughout these years and her dedicated living within the Reiki practice gave all of her students the benefit of Mikao Usui's gift. Her granddaughter, Phyllis Lei Furumoto, now carries on her work. Usui Shiki Ryoho is taught through an oral tradition of teaching, sharing information, and exchanging treatments. This practice is not something that can be learned by reading a book—it is something to experience by receiving a treatment, taking a class, and talking with Reiki practitioners, students, and masters who practice this form.
