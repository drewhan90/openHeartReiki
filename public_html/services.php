        I truly believe that we need to heal on all levels of our being. 
        <br>
        Reiki and meditation can help you to explore your emotions, transformed your mind and body, and showed you the beauty of Life and Love.
        <br>
        Reiki is not something that can be learned by reading a book—it is something to experience by receiving a treatment, taking a class, and talking with Reiki practitioners, students, and masters who practice this form.

      Usui Shiki Ryoho (the Usui System of Natural Healing or Reiki Healing) is named after its founder, Dr. Mikao Usui. Relying on an oral history, the story of Dr. Usui's journey is one filled with the desire to seek the answer to a burning question of "How did Jesus heal?" His dedication to his search and his individual gifts allowed him to receive the gift of Reiki. After receiving the gift of connection with Reiki energy, he spent the rest of his life developing the system of practice allowing this gift of connection to be passed on to others. The immense gift of this method of passing on the connection has survived many generations and has remained viable throughout the cultures of the world.
      <br><br> 
      Chujiro Hayashi continued his studentship of Usui Shiki Ryoho by opening a clinic. His clinic allowed him to observe the effects of the treatment on many people with many different ailments. 
      <br><br>
      Mrs. Hawayo Takata of Hawaii recovered from her serious ailments at Hayashi’s Reiki clinic and became his first student who did not live in Japan. She practiced and taught throughout the US and Canada from 1937 to her death in 1980. Her legacy of treatment throughout these years and her dedicated living within the Reiki practice gave all of her students the benefit of Mikao Usui's gift. Her granddaughter, Phyllis Lei Furumoto, now carries on her work.
      <br><br> 
      Usui Shiki Ryoho is taught through an oral tradition of teaching, sharing information, and exchanging treatments. This practice is not something that can be learned by reading a book—it is something to experience by receiving a treatment, taking a class, and talking with Reiki practitioners, students, and masters who practice this form.

            Full Moon Women's Circle.
            <br>
            As women, gather together to connect with the sacred energies of the Moon during its fullest. Historically, women came together to celebrate the full moon in order to feel centered and open. This lengths your positive feelings. The full moon pours a huge amount of energy to the Earth.
            Let's honor this tradition and come together in a circle of divine Goddesses to connect with the Goddess Mother, our feminine power and our sisters.
            <br>
            We will help each other to raise our vibration to a higher level by chanting, meditating and dancing together. We will create a divine space to support each other to mature our spirit and set up new goals for the upcoming month.
            Awakening your feminine side, your Shakti, will bring you peace of mind, stillness and balance and fill you with energy that you can share with your loved ones.
            <br>
            We will do a different meditation each time.
            Please wear something that makes you feel like a Goddess: bright, beautiful, and shiny.
            <br>
            Women circles are currently held at Karma teachers every full moon.
            <br>
            Please check the <a href="http://karmateachers.com/">Karma Teachers website</a> for more information. 
            <br>
            The Address is 45 West Hastings, Vancouver, British Columbia V6B1G4.
