      Usui Shiki Ryoho (the Usui System of Natural Healing or Reiki Healing) is named after its founder, Dr. Mikao Usui. Relying on an oral history, the story of Dr. Usui's journey is one filled with the desire to seek the answer to a burning question of "How did Jesus heal?" His dedication to his search and his individual gifts allowed him to receive the gift of Reiki. After receiving the gift of connection with Reiki energy, he spent the rest of his life developing the system of practice allowing this gift of connection to be passed on to others. The immense gift of this method of passing on the connection has survived many generations and has remained viable throughout the cultures of the world.
      <br><br> 
      Chujiro Hayashi continued his studentship of Usui Shiki Ryoho by opening a clinic. His clinic allowed him to observe the effects of the treatment on many people with many different ailments. 
      <br><br>
      Mrs. Hawayo Takata of Hawaii recovered from her serious ailments at Hayashi’s Reiki clinic and became his first student who did not live in Japan. She practiced and taught throughout the US and Canada from 1937 to her death in 1980. Her legacy of treatment throughout these years and her dedicated living within the Reiki practice gave all of her students the benefit of Mikao Usui's gift. Her granddaughter, Phyllis Lei Furumoto, now carries on her work.
      <br><br> 
      Usui Shiki Ryoho is taught through an oral tradition of teaching, sharing information, and exchanging treatments. This practice is not something that can be learned by reading a book—it is something to experience by receiving a treatment, taking a class, and talking with Reiki practitioners, students, and masters who practice this form.

            As many of us, I had a very ordinary life of an office clerk. I lived in Russia and was doing okay in this busy business world. Although, my life was very stable, I felt empty, useless and unhappy. I was angry at people around me, very often feeling sick or depressed. My only joy was the passion to travel and be around interesting people in the places where I can learn something new. This curiosity to see the world and learn more about it brought me to Vancouver for a short trip and made me stay here for a new chapter of my journey. My spiritual parth opened up on its fullest in Canada.
            <br><br>
            I was lucky to meet my teacher; dear friend and Reiki Master the second day of my arrival in 2011 and began a deep healing for my body and my soul. I got introduced to Reiki first and experienced it’s profound healing power right away, which helped me to manage my daily pain from the chronic illness I had, lightened my mood and opened my heart and eyes to be in a present moment to enjoy every moment in its beauty.
            <br><br>
            Shortly after, my self-exploration journey continued with meditation. Osho dynamic mediations allowed me to open up my repressed feelings and look into suppressed emotions, fear, anger, childhood traumas and issues in my daily life. I have been practicing Osho meditations for several years now and went to a blessed land of India to study with an enlightened master Swami Samdarshi, who is a disciple of Osho.
            <br><br>
            I truly believe that we need to heal on all levels of our being; Reiki and meditations helped me to explore my emotions, transformed my mind and body, and showed me the beauty of Life and Love.
            When I was ready for a deeper physical transformation and my body was healthy enough I received a gift of yoga.
            I have taken Teacher Training program at "Karma Teachers" and that opened an understanding in me of the importance of movement and exploration of the connection between the physical and spiritual.
            <br><br>
            My longing to get to know myself better led me to look into my nature of being a woman and connect to Goddess Mother – divine power of Shakti Ma and source of creation all around us. For us women is very important to understand this divine power of feminine, compassion and love, so we are able to be confident, rooted, fearless and giving in this fast paced world.
            I am grateful to God and Universe for this wonderful unpredictable journey called life, grateful for being able to follow my true purpose in this life to serve people and help them to transform their beings and bring them closer to light, divine source, their true selves. I am looking forward to meet you, hear your life journey and work together on how to make your journey of life happier, healthier and brighter.
